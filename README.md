# Password Card

My shot at a password card application!
Inspired by the [original password card](https://www.passwordcard.org) idea.

Uses the [Forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) library
for a JavaScript SHA256 implementation

**DISCLAIMER**: This is a na√Øve implementation of a password card, and thus
may not be a secure one. Furthermore, it is a work-in-progress, so it might
change in functionality and design at any time.
